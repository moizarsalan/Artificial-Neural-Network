ask of this project is to train a deep learning model that is able to solve an object detection problem. The specific problem solved in this notebook is "Facemask carrying detection" problem, where the deep learning model needs to detect if people are wearing masks or not.

Dataset used for this purpose has images belonging to three classes - no mask, mask and mask worn incorrectly.

Objective:
Identifying whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, and whether they are wearing it correctly.

YOLO model
In this notebook, YOLOv5 model is used for training.

YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time, and is an acronym for “You Only Look Once”. As the name suggests, the algorithm requires only a single forward propagation through a neural network to detect objects. [1]

YOLO algorithm aims to predict a class of an object and the bounding box that defines the object location on the input image. In addition to that, YOLO predicts the corresponding number c for the predicted class as well as the probability of the prediction. [2]
